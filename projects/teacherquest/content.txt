The TeacherQuest team came to Blenderbox looking for a way to translate their in-person workshops into an online experience. In turn, we developed a scalable Rails application that turned their vision into a reality.

I served as the lead user-experience designer for the project, along side a developer and a visual designer.

How TeacherQuest Works
The online teacherquest experience is simular to that of a call and response. TeacherQuest administrations post game-making challenges to their "Cohorts" ( small group of local participants), and the users would then reply with creative responses.

PlayQuicks - Short, weekly challenges that are designed to take no longer than a few hours.

Design Challenges - In-depth, Bi-Monthly challenges that teachers are required to build upon and test in their classrooms

These two types of content are the centerpiece of TeacherQuest experience, and we designed the application to center around these challenges.
