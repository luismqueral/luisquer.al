      <div class="project-description">
          <p> I created this during my sophomore year in college (2012). I was in the middle of beginning my senior thesis and desperately needed a break from all of the concentration I was dedicating to it.

          <p>I took a few videos from archive.org in addition to a botched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact#Artistic_use">data-moshing</a> tutorial that I started earlier and began experimenting with Premiere's blend modes and key queuing functionalities. There are about four or 5 separate videos playing simultaneously, blended in various ways.

          <p>In the background is a persistent, corrupted video. While I was working on this, Premiere kept crashing, but I kept pressing on and managed to actually render this bad boy out.

          <p>The music in the background is from an earlier series of time stretching experiments using Ableton Live. I took the song “I’m Falling” by the Peanut Butter Conspiracy and stretched it out from 2:41 to 15:06 or so. Ableton Live has variety of different ways to time stretch audio (‘beats’, ‘complex’, ‘complex pro’, etc.) each resulting in their own unique styles of stretching audio out.

          <p> What you hear is the result of three identical tracks being play simultaneously, but using different time-stretch algorithms. One track is panned hard right, the other hard left, and the last track centered. I did this to isloate the small subtleties and give the piece a fuller sound.

          <p> Later on, I found that the resulting audio/visual collage created a strange, completely unintentional narrative.
